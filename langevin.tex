%However, because the precise nature of the bath coupling should be irrelevant, Ohmic damping and memoryless force are typically assumed for simplicity in classical molecular dynamics simulations. The spectral density of the correlation functions reflects the frequency-dependence of the bath-system coupling and, for quantum systems, the Bose-Einstein statistics in the bath.
