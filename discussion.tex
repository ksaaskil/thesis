\subsection{Application to electron transport}


The same principles as outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:th_schb} for phonon transport can be directly applied to electron transport as well, when Langevin heat baths are replaced by electron baths. In this case, the self-consistent baths are often referred to as voltage-temperature probes \cite{jacquet09}. Previous applications of voltage-temperature probe models for describing dissipation effects in electron transport have been limited to one-dimensional geometries \cite{buttiker86,damato90,jacquet09,jacquet12}. Recently, Bergfield et al. used the model for investigating quantum temperature oscillations in graphene \cite{bergfield15}.
