\draftabstract{Swift progress in the synthesis and processing of materials with nanoscale structures has spawned new ways to control the flow of thermal energy. Mastering the capabilities to engineer new materials and devices with tailored thermal properties is expected to enable, e.g., clean and more efficient production of energy from waste heat by thermoelectric converters, reducing the energy consumption of digital electronics, and generating novel technologies such as heat-assisted magnetic recording and phase-change memories. As the classical laws of energy transfer do not generally apply in nanoscale, practical realization of such applications calls for powerful computational methods delivering scientific understanding of nanoscale heat transfer.

The goal of this thesis is to develop new computational models and methods for describing nanoscale energy transfer and to apply the methods to generate useful insight into various thermal phenomena. The results include, e.g., new methods to spectrally decompose the lattice heat current into its frequency components, allowing detailed analysis of thermal transfer in non-linear systems. The work provides substantial new insight on the role of non-linear processes in thermal conduction across interfaces and in the non-diffusive thermal conduction in carbon nanotubes up to 10 $\upmu$m lengths as well as on increasing thermoelectric efficiency in silicon nanowires by the introduction of periodic stacking faults, and demonstrates the possibility to tune electromagnetic energy transfer between nanoparticles by a mirror cavity.

As a whole, the thesis initiates the development of a unified fluctuational model for describing energy transfer by lattice vibrations, electromagnetic fields, and electrons in a single mathematical framework than can generate substantial new insight on the thermal phenomena present in small structures. More specifically, the methods and results of the thesis provide new analytical and numerical tools for describing nanoscale energy transfer within a framework that may, with further development, become instrumental also in modeling complete multiscale energy conversion processes and systems involving heat, light and electricity.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Summary of article contents}

\textbf{Publication I} investigates the role of anharmonic phonon scattering in thermal conduction across planar material interfaces. The analysis relies on the newly developed expression for the spectral decomposition of heat current, evaluated numerically from the atomic trajectories extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that anharmonic phonon scattering facilitates thermal conduction across the interface by providing a dissipation mechanism for evanescent waves and by enabling multi-phonon energy transfer processes at the interface.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Publication II} applies the spectral analysis method of \textbf{Publication I} to determine the frequency-dependent phonon mean free paths in carbon nanotubes. The determined mean free paths directly reflect the decay of heat current in non-equilibrium, allowing for straightforwardly assessing the contributions of different vibrational frequencies to thermal conduction in tubes of different length. Room-temperature mean free paths in carbon nanotubes are shown to exceed 10 $\upmu$m at low frequencies, highlighting their potential applications in thermal management. 

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Publication III} studies the effect of periodic twinning stacking faults on the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the nanowire thermal conductivity can be notably reduced by the periodic twinning, suggesting the possibility to increase the thermoelectric efficiency by such superlattice structures.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Publications IV, V} and \textbf{VI} focus on thermal conduction in nanoscale point contacts. Simulations for point contacts in a two-dimensional square lattice reveal interference patterns in local temperature profiles, not captured by Fourier's law. Quantum statistics are shown to modify temperature profiles in point contacts at low temperatures, but the effect is shown to be weak for graphene at room temperature.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Publication VII} presents Langevin theory of electromagnetic energy transfer, providing an alternative description to the traditional fluctuational electrodynamics. Numerical results for nanoparticles in a mirror cavity demonstrate the possibility to tune the rate of electromagnetic energy transfer between dielectric bodies by an inhomogeneous environment.
